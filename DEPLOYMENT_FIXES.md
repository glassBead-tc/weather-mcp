# Deployment Fixes for Smithery Tool Scanning Timeout

## Problem Analysis

**Issue**: MCP error -32001: Request timed out during tool scanning
**Root Causes**:
1. **Transport Override**: Smithery automatically changes `streamable-http` to `stdio` via sed during build
2. **Eager Loading**: HTTP dependencies loaded at module import time, not lazily
3. **Tool Scanning**: Smithery requires lazy loading for tool discovery

## Current fix-github-action-transport Branch Solutions

### âœ… Implemented Fixes

1. **Lazy Loading Configuration**
   - Moved `httpx` import inside functions (`get_http_client()`)
   - Moved API URL to lazy function (`get_weather_api_url()`)
   - Removed module-level dependency imports

2. **Transport Compatibility**
   - Smart transport detection: detects Smithery environment
   - Falls back to `stdio` when needed, `streamable-http` for development
   - Respects Smithery's automatic sed replacement

3. **Timeout Prevention Tools**
   - Added `ping()` and `health_check()` tools for quick responses
   - HTTP client timeouts (10s) for external API calls
   - Graceful error handling in all tools

4. **GitHub Actions Integration**
   - Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for monitoring
   - Automated testing and validation
   - Security scanning with Bandit/Safety
   - Deployment readiness analysis

### ðŸ”§ Key Code Changes

#### Lazy Loading Pattern
```python
# Before: Eager loading
import httpx
WEATHER_API = "https://wttr.in"

# After: Lazy loading  
def get_http_client():
    import httpx
    return httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=10.0)

def get_weather_api_url():
    return "https://wttr.in"
```

#### Transport Compatibility
```python
# Smart transport detection
if os.getenv("SMITHERY_DEPLOYMENT") or "--stdio" in sys.argv:
    mcp.run(transport="stdio")
else:
    mcp.run(transport="streamable-http")
```

#### Tool Structure
```python
@mcp.tool()
async def ping() -> str:
    """Simple ping tool to test server responsiveness."""
    return "pong"

@mcp.tool()
async def get_weather(city: str, units: str = "metric", detailed: bool = False) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get current weather for a city."""
    # Lazy load dependencies inside tool
    from urllib.parse import quote
    async with get_http_client() as client:
        # Implementation
```

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Tool Scanning**: Should complete successfully with lazy loading
2. **Transport Compatibility**: Works with both Smithery (stdio) and local (HTTP)
3. **Performance**: Faster startup with lazy loading
4. **Monitoring**: GitHub Actions provides real-time pipeline status

## Testing Strategy

1. **Local Testing**: Verify lazy loading and transport detection
2. **GitHub Actions**: Automated validation on push
3. **Smithery Deployment**: Test actual deployment with fixed configuration
4. **Tool Scanning**: Verify tools are discoverable without timeout

## Monitoring Integration

The `deployment_pipeline_monitor.py` provides:
- Real-time GitHub workflow monitoring
- Smithery deployment health checks
- Pipeline status analysis
- Automated recommendations

This comprehensive approach addresses the lazy loading requirements and transport compatibility issues that were causing the tool scanning timeouts.
